# Faceless

*Faceless* is a 2D platform game, which was a product of a process of learning Unity2D. Over time, features that I wanted to implement expanded, along with it the time I would have to put to fully develop the game. It was a great building-up experience with Unity environment and C#.


Faceless has a dash attribute that allows to dodge enemy's attack
